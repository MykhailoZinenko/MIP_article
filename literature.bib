abstract = {Recommendation systems are gaining increasing popularity in many application areas like e-commerce, movie and music recommendations, tourism, news, advertisement, stock markets, social networks etc. Conventional recommendation systems either use content based or collaborative filtering based approaches to model user preferences and give recommendations. These systems usually fail to consider evolving user preferences in different contextual situations. Context Aware Recommendation Systems take different contextual attributes into consideration and try to capture user preferences correctly. This survey focuses on the state-of-the art computational intelligence techniques trying to improve conventional design using contextual information. Further, these techniques are grouped into bio-inspired computing techniques and statistical computing techniques. The literature related to these techniques mentioning their ability to handle challenges faced by Context Aware Recommendation System are presented in this survey. The survey also talks about context inclusion strategies, classification of the contexts used in the literature reviewed, their impact on the problems faced by the recommendation systems, effective usage of these contexts, datasets used in the domain, future research scope in all the reviewed techniques and overall future research directions and challenges.}

abstract = {Background: Software engineers can utilise a myriad of elicitation techniques to capture relevant information in order to specify requirements. The effectiveness of these techniques varies depending on the context in which the elicitation takes place. So, it is important to identify the attributes that represent this context. Objective: This paper aims to match theoretical to empirical research on contextual attributes that influence elicitation technique effectiveness. Method: We conduct a systematic mapping study to identify proposed attributes (by theoretical works) and attributes studied empirically. Then we map empirical results with theoretical proposals. Results: 60% of theoretically proposed attributes have been studied empirically. There seems to be some degree of coordination between theory and empiricism. However, there is empirical confirmation of the impact of only a third of the theoretically proposed attributes. Conclusions: These results call for more empirical research in order to evaluate beliefs with respect to elicitation techniques.}
